An Intro to Docker
==================

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

`Online Tutorial`_. The tutorial uses an emulator to give you a feel of docker on the command line.

`Docker on Mac`_. To get started on Mac requires Boot2Docker which is a VM that runs Docker. Because the Docker daemon uses Linux-specific kernel features, you can't run Docker natively in OS X. Instead, you must install the Boot2Docker application. The application includes a VirtualBox Virtual Machine (VM), Docker itself, and the Boot2Docker management tool.
