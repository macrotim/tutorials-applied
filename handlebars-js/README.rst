Handlebars.js
=============

Written in JavaScript, Handlebars.js is a compiler that takes any HTML and Handlebars expression and compiles them to a JavaScript function. This derived JavaScript function then takes one parameter, an object—your data—and it returns a string with the HTML and the object properties’ values inserted into the HTML. So, you end up with a string that has the values from the object properties inserted in the relevant places, and you insert that string as HTML on the page.
