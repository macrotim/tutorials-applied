Lettuce
=======

Lettuce is an extremely useful and charming tool for BDD (Behavior Driven Development). It can execute plain-text functional descriptions as automated tests for Python projects, just as Cucumber does for Ruby.

Lettuce makes the development and testing process really easy, scalable, readable and - what is best - it allows someone who doesnâ€™t program to describe the behavior of a certain system, without imagining those descriptions will automatically test the system during its development.
