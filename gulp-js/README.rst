Gulp.js
=======

Gulp.js makes use of pipes for streaming data that needs to be processed. Its syntax for setting up tasks to me is extremely simple compared to a gruntfile. There's also a vast array of plugins out there to make everyday tasks a breeze, like minifying code, uglifying javascript, watching files and livereloading the browser when files have changed.
