========

The Python interface to the Redis key-value store.

Redis is an open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store with optional durability. It is written in ANSI C. The development of Redis has been sponsored by Pivotal since May 2013; before that, it was sponsored by VMware. According to the monthly ranking by DB-Engines.com, Redis is the most popular key-value store. The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.

To get a Redis instance running within Docker on Mac, from within boot2docker:

  docker run -p 6379:6379 --name my-redis -d redis

Then use "boot2docker ip" to get the IP address.
