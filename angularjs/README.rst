Egghead Videos on Angular.js
============================

For a lighter crash course on Angular.js, the Egghead videos are short and use live coding sessions to demonstrate Angular.js.

Note: The Controllers lesson works up to Angular version 1.3.0 and errors out starting at 1.3.0.

Angular.js Directives
=====================

At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform the DOM element and its children.
